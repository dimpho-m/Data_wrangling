Where do you apply this function to extract the integer values from the df:

def numerate(string_pair):
    num_list = [int(s) for s in re.findall('\d+', str(string_pair))]
    return num_list

The 'For' loop can't read number in brackets (x,y) as this is a string, applying above function properly first should solve this problem

Remember, 'use functional programming techniques (map, reduce, apply) instead of loops when writing the functions'
