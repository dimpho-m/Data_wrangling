    "#### The following notebook will explore data wrangling with the use of recruitment personality scores data. Applicants are required to complete a personality survey and that data is used as input for this notebook. The five factors observed in the survey are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticsm or Emotional stability (OCEAN). These traits will form the subscale for the various data aplications and manipulations below. The structure of the notebook is as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Validation \n",
    "#### The data from the personality scores file is read in and checked for unique entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Subscale calculation \n",
    "#### A function is defined to take in and convert the answers from the personality survey to numbers. The total scores for each subscale are then calculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Subscale interpretation \n",
    "#### A function is defined that takes in subscale totals as a parameter and returns a new dataframe with a new column that labels the subscale score as 'high', 'medium' or 'low', which we will henceforth refer to as the score category . \n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Merge dataframes \n",
    "#### The department dataframe is merged with the personality score dataframe, retaining all applicants within the various departments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Data Visualization \n",
    "#### A histogram plotting the personality scores with the various departments is depicted. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Dataframe Filtration\n",
    "#### The merged dataframe is filtered for candidates that have a 'low' label on the Neuroticsm, Conscientiousness and Agreeableness traits. Such identified candidates, by department, are placed in a new column with the tag 'high risk'. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Count Dataframe\n",
    "#### A new dataframe is made with the count of the number of applicants in each score category within each subscale and department. \n",
